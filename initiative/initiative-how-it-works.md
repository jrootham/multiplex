Awesome — let’s craft a clear, engaging, and purpose-aligned draft of the **“How the Initiative Works”** page. This will focus on what’s being proposed (the structure and mechanism), keeping it accessible for both prospective members and aligned partners.

## 🏗️ **Draft: How the TMDC Initiative Works**

---

### What Are We Building?

The Toronto Multiplex Development Co-operative (TMDC) is creating a **repeatable, community-led housing model** that enables everyday people to co-own and govern their homes in the form of small, climate-conscious multiplexes.

The initiative is designed to operate outside traditional for-profit development models and without long-term reliance on government subsidies. It’s built to be financially self-sustaining, radically transparent, and deeply participatory.

---

### Core Structure: A System of Co-ops

At the heart of this initiative is a network of **interdependent co-operatives**, each playing a specific role in making housing stable, affordable, and community-run. Together, they form an ecosystem for continuously delivering resident-owned housing.

There are three main co-ops in this system:

---

#### 1. **Development Co-op**

_“Where the process begins”_

- **Purpose**: Acquires land, plans development, and coordinates the build of each multiplex.
- **Members**: Prospective resident households (on the waitlist).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manages the intake process for future residents.
  - Collects member loans and escrow contributions.
  - Commissions design and construction of new buildings.

This co-op ensures that development is **driven by the people who will live there**, not speculative interests.

---

#### 2. **Financing Co-op**

_“Funding the future we want to live in”_

- **Purpose**: Provides ethical financing through community bonds and member-based lending.
- **Members**: Operating co-ops (i.e., the co-ops running each housing project).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Issues community bonds for early-stage capital.
  - Offers long-term mortgages tailored for co-operative housing.
  - Maintains transparency and stability in housing finance.

This co-op replaces extractive financial intermediaries with a **values-aligned, mission-driven financing engine**.

---

#### 3. **Operating Co-op (Housing Co-op)**

_“The home you help run”_

- **Purpose**: Governs and maintains the completed multiplex buildings.
- **Members**: Resident households.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Sets and manages cost-covering monthly housing charges (rent).
  - Oversees operations, repairs, and shared responsibilities.
  - Facilitates democratic governance through member meetings, committees, and elections.

This co-op ensures residents have **direct control over their housing conditions, costs, and community life**.

---

### Why This Structure?

This model is intentionally designed to be:

- **Scalable** – Each new building can be part of the broader system or spun off as its own co-op once established.
- **Modular** – Financing, development, and operations are coordinated but separable.
- **Accountable** – Each co-op is member-run and answerable to the people it serves.
- **Resilient** – By distributing power and building independence from any single entity, the system is robust to external shifts.

---

### A Note on Other Co-op Types

In the future, additional specialized co-ops may emerge (e.g., heat pump co-ops, parking co-ops) to provide shared services. These would be built on the same values: resident ownership, transparency, and ecological stewardship.

## Implementation

The folowing pages describe the implementation steps and strategies.

## System Structure

There are three main co-ops in this system. **Development**, **Financing**, and **Operating**:

1. **Development Co-Op**: finds land, purchases it, and arranges for the construction of a multiplex on it. Its members are people on the waiting list. It also manages that list by interviewing prospective members and dealing with member loans and escrow money.
2. **Financing Co-Op**: sells bonds and writes mortgages.
3. **Operating Co-Op**: runs the housing co-op.

There are other possible co-ops. Parking and heat pumps might be separate if the neighbours are invited to be part of them. [Learn more about co-ops](membership/membership-learn-about-co-ops) -->

<!-- ## Organizational Design

### 1. Development Co-op

- Members: Households on the waitlist
- Role: Land acquisition, project development, membership onboarding

### 2. Finance Co-op

- Members: Housing co-ops
- Role: Issue community bonds, provide long-term mortgage financing

### 3. Housing Co-ops

- Members: Resident households
- Role: Operate, maintain, and govern individual housing sites

### 4. Supporting Co-ops (Optional)

- Heat Pump, Parking, Credit Union
- Role: Provide shared infrastructure and services -->
