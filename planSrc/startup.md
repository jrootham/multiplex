# Startup Process

Since this project involves an incremental approach to developing housing co-ops some attention must be paid to the first buildings.

Because administration costs are not supportable by very small co-ops and they can be supplied on a remote basis to some degree the first buildings will all belong to the same co-op, even if they are not in the same neighbourhood. There will be a need for efforts to build more buildings in the same neighbourhood.  Assuming that is successful separate co-ops will be created when the group reaches about 20 households, so about 4 6-plexes.

The initial co-op administration services (including bookkeeping) will be supplied by the development co-op.  It is expected that this will incur only a small incremental cost (while the initial co-op is small).

It is planned that the administration service requirements will be met with part time staff until the housing co-op is large.
