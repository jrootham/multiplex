# Transition

When a building is done people on the waiting list with enough money to cover the member loan are elegible to join the new co-op.

They must pass an orientation interview.

Initially this will be done by the development co-op, later by the housing co-ops.

People who sell the land to the land trust are first in line to join the co-op.
