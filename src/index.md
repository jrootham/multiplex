# Executive Summary

The primary objective of this proposal is to build a lot of non profit co-operative housing in Toronto.

A secondary objective is to improve the livability and effiency of the suburbs.

The proposed method to achieve these goals is to build an ecosystem of organizations to plan, finance, build, and govern the housing.  Some of these will be existing organizations (notably builders) while others will be new.

This will be a long running continuous process. 

It is not clear what the limits to scale will be.  The real open question is the effective demand.  Given that this is unsubsidized building, it will not meet any definition of affordable housing.
