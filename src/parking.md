## Parking Co-op

One of the issues with 6-plexes in the suburbs is parking.  Putting it on site means underground, likely expensive, inflexible, and puts more cars on the street you live on.

An alternative is to buy a property on a connecting street and put parking there.  You could start with a lot and build a garage when that gets full.  The garage could include charging stations for each stall.  

If you make this a separate co-op other local residents could also make use of it.  This would likely be more attractive as electric cars become a larger part of the fleet mix.
