# Pricing

In this context pricing is the charge for development services provided by the development co-op to the housing co-op paid out of the capital cost of the building.  It needs to be break even, but not much more than that.

At this point the pricing is proposed to be fairly arbitrarily set at $4,000 per unit. This should be less than about 1% of the capital cost of the unit.  For comparison, for profit developers need to have this be over 20% of the capital cost of a unit.
