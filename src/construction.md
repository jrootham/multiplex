### Building

Post and beam mass timber construction (no load bearing interior walls)

Factory assembled components (walls and floors (bathrooms?  kitchens?))

Small number of sizes

Current theory suggests:
* 25x40 3 story, 2 1 beds (450 sq ft) 2 2/3 beds (900 sq ft) (semi detached)
* 30x50 3 story, 2 2 beds (700 sq ft) 2 3/4 beds (1,400 sq ft)
* 40x40 3 story, 2 2 beds (750 sq ft) 2 3/4 beds (1,500 sq ft)

Assumes stairs and elevator are outside the basic box

Consistent delivery schedule for long term planning
