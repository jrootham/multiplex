## Who's going to actually do this?

	Ultimately, you.

	Currently, development is led by a group that has lived in and run co-ops for many years.

	The organization doing the development is a co-op. So you, as a member, elect the board that sets the direction.

	There will be employees and partners that understand the technical issues.
