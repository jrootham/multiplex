# Why co-ops

Non profit housing co-ops are corporations that provide housing to their members.  It is controlled by a board elected by its members.  Each member provides a member loan and pays monthly housing charge (rent) to cover the capital and operating costs (including mortgage payments and savings for large repairs and replacements).  The housing charges are set by a general members meeting.

The fundamental advantage of co-ops is that the charges cover the actual cost of the co-op, without paying the landlord's profits.  Over time the difference tends to become larger.
