# Principles

The fundamental purpose of this proposal is to build housing.  To do this both effectively and ethically, there are several principles it will adhere to.

Scale is one of the most important principles.  The intention is to build a lot of housing by continuously building small scale developments.  To this end we will target single lots large enough to build multiplexes.  This puts us in the suburbs.  Also, to simplify each development we will need to avoid the Committee of Adjustment.  That reduces time, money, and risk.  None of which do we have a great capacity to absorb.

There is a development organization which will continuously develop buildings to be incorporated into the operating organization.  

Both organizations are not for profit, this is critically important for the operating organization.

Both organizations are co-operatives.  This form of organization is the best mechanism for aligning goals with control.

To the maximum extent possible, these organizations are designed for independence, both from government and private institutions.  They will join with other organizations with aligned goals.  This is important to maximise scale and minimize time, and, in general, to improve efficiency.

In order to raise money these organizations must be seen as manifestly not scams.  This will be eased by not being scams.  The principle of radical transparency will help in being manifestly not a scam. Financial regulators are somewhat exempt from the principle of independence in order to increase clarity about not being a scam.
