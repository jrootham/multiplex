# Pitch

What if your landlord wasn't looking for profit? What if you and your neighbours were in complete control? What if you couldn't be renovicted or surprised by a rent increase? What if you could have a permanent reliable home without paying Toronto real estate prices?

We have an opportunity to do something new, that was illegal for 60 years. We're going to create potentially endless amounts of ideal housing, homes that will raise our quality of life.

We're building co-ops. New co-ops, in the inner suburbs. We're also building multiplexes, the incredibly popular (and recently legalized) small buildings with 4-6` homes per building.

Co-ops are housing where the residents (members) are in charge. Rent is decided (democratically) at a rate just enough to cover for expenses, not to pay for someone else's retirement.

## Executive Summary

The primary objective of this proposal is to build a lot of non profit co-operative housing in Toronto.

A secondary objective is to improve the livability and effiency of the suburbs.

The proposed method to achieve these goals is to build an ecosystem of organizations to plan, finance, build, and govern the housing. Some of these will be existing organizations (notably builders) while others will be new.

This will be a long running continuous process.

It is not clear what the limits to scale will be. The real open question is the effective demand. Given that this is an unsubsidized building, it will not meet any definition of affordable housing.

### Principles

The fundamental purpose of this proposal is to build housing. To do this both effectively and ethically, there are several principles it will adhere to.

There is a development organization which will continuously develop buildings to be incorporated into the operating organization.

Both organizations are not for profit, this is critically important for the operating organization.

Both organizations are co-operatives. This form of organization is the best mechanism for aligning goals with control. See [Rochdale Principles](rochdale.html).

Transparency is an important principle, this needs to be true to the point of them being described as radically transparent. This will be helpful for both members and others who are deaaling with these organizations.

Scale is also one of the principles. The intention is to build a lot of housing by continuously building small scale developments. To this end we will target single lots large enough to build multiplexes. This puts us in the suburbs.

We have to stay within the rules. Most development in Toronto needs to go beyond the precise rules, there is a process to do that but it increases time, money, and risk. None of which do we have a great capacity to absorb.

To the maximum extent possible, these organizations are designed for independence, both from government and private institutions. They will join with other organizations with aligned goals. This is important to maximise scale and minimize time, and, in general, to improve efficiency.

In order to raise money these organizations must be seen as manifestly not scams. This will be eased by not being scams. The principle of radical transparency will help in being manifestly not a scam. Financial regulators are somewhat exempt from the principle of independence in order to increase clarity about not being a scam.

## Why co-ops

Non profit housing co-ops are corporations that provide housing to their members. It is controlled by a board elected by its members. Each member provides a member loan and pays monthly housing charge (rent) to cover the capital and operating costs (including mortgage payments and savings for large repairs and replacements). The housing charges are set by a general members meeting.

They are one of a number of kinds of organizations that subscribe to the [Rochdale Principles](rochdale.html)

The fundamental advantage of co-ops is that the charges cover the actual cost of the co-op, without paying the landlord's profits. Over time the difference tends to become larger.

There are other prosocial advantages of co-ops. Notably, practise with democratic institutions. This may be even more pronounced with people who grow up in co-ops.

The Co-op Housing Federation of Toronto enhances this with diversity scholarships for co-op members.

Co-ops are not all sweetness and light. The trouble with co-ops is that people have to co-operate.

They are democracies. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It requires your engagement.

The good news is that you are in charge, so you have a say in what happens.

The bad news is that you are in charge, so you are responsible.

## Multiplexes

A multiplex is a small apartment building. The difference between an apartment building and a multiplex is simply one of terminology. Current usage says that multiplexes start at 2 apartments (duplex). The upper limit is somewhat amorphous, but one would expect a ten unit building to be referred to as an apartment building.

The big advantage of multiplexes is the balance between the land use efficiency of a high rise and the desirabiliy of a single family home. Jan Gehl in "Cities for People" used human perception studies to identify 25 metres as the maximum height for people to relate to the street.

The density enabled by multiplexes should be enough to transform car dependent suburbs into walkable neighbourhoods.

## Project High Level Outline

The following pages are a high level outline of the project.

This includes the project goals, the steps needed to achieve the goals, and a timeline.

### Goals

The immediate goal of the project is to build an ecosystem of organizations to plan, finance, build, and govern non profit co-op housing in Toronto.

One of the major problems in Toronto is the lack of stable, affordable family housing. Non profit co-ops may well be the best solution to this problem. However, historically these have been built with government assistance, but with the election of conservative governments this activity has been crushed.

In order to maintain a consistent supply of this housing we need to build mechanisms to deliver it without government support, and possibly, in the teeth of government opposition.

Another Toronto issue is the dominance of the car dependent suburbs. These are incredibly costly and significantly subsidized. They also create substantial ecological problems. A secondary objective of this project is to gradually reduce the car dependence by increasing the density, and ultimately, create walkable neighbourhoods.

The plan is to build highly energy efficient housing, which will address the wider problem of climate change.

You can be part of this transformative project, and get stable, long term affordable housing to boot.

### Next steps

Winter and early spring of 2025 will be taken up with project design and organization. This will include building a sign up page, connecting with partners, and arranging the finance structure.

Spring and early summer will be spent getting people to do the expression of interest signing up. This is the first go/no go [decision point](decision.html).

The legal organization will be done in the late summer.

Getting members to sign up and advancing the money will happen in the fall. This is the second go/no go [decision point](decision.html).

When the members are signed up a board will be elected which will make the final decisions on staffing and building design and whatever else needs settling.

Property acquisition and getting permits will begin to happen in the winter. It is an open question whether construction starts immediately or waits until spring. This process will continue indefinitely.

## Co-op multiplex project outline

- Bike parking

#### Desirable

- Flexible interior spaces

#### Optional

- Front yard play areas
- Transfer title to indigenous land bank
- Maker spaces in the back yards

### Implementation

The folowing pages describe the implementation steps and strategies.

#### Financing

There are two timescales to finance building a multiplex. There is development, a short period that has no income, and operating, a long period with income.

The development period will be financed with short term community bonds. Community bonds are sold to people with money who support the aims of the project. They pay interest, typically below market rate.

The operating period will be financed through member loans (5% of capital costs) and mortgages provided by a finance co-op that will sell variable rate bonds to raise the funds for the mortgages.

#### Structure

There are three main co-ops in this system. Development, operating, and financing.

The development co-op finds land, purchases it, and arranges for the construction of a multiplex on it. Its members are people on the waiting list. It also manages that list by interviewing prospective members and dealing with member loans and escrow money.

The financing co-op sells bonds and writes mortgages.

The operating co-op runs the housing co-op.

There are other possible co-ops. Parking and heat pumps might be separate if the neighbours are invitedd to be part of them.

#### Steps

##### Pitch site

The first thing to do is create a pitch site. This requires completing the design of the project, writing advertising copy, and implementing a signup page. Some partnership connections need to be made at this point to determine costs accurately enough to fairly present the options to applicants.

##### Connect with partners

We need to connect with the partners required to implement the project. At this point we are looking for expressions of interest and possibly early cost estimates.

##### Launch pitch

This is primarily an advertising campaign in order to get the pitch site in front of potential members. Current thinking thinking is that this means a launch event and media campaigns (including social media and earned media).

##### Get pitch responses

This is primarily waiting for people to fill in the application. We will also have to respond to questions.

This is the first go/no go decision point in the project. If there is not enough interest at this point the project will not proceed. See [Decision point](decision.html).

##### Formalization

This is mostly legal issues. It would start with incorporation of all the co-ops. We would need to confirm the regulatory issues surrounding the variable rate bonds. This may take significant time. Agreements with partners would need to be confirmed with letters of intent.

##### Sign membership agreements

We need to sign membership agreements and receive member loans and escrow deposits from applicants. This is the second go/no go decision point. See [Decision point](decision.html).

##### Sign partnership agreements

Signing partnership agreements is the final legal step required before land acquisition occurs and the building process begins.

##### Build

For each property and building we need to: acquire property, get building approval, start building, finish building and move people in.

#### Timeline

This will be replaced with a spreadsheet output.
