		<h1>Multiplex Co-ops</h1>

	<h2>Pitch</h2>


	<p>
		What if your landlord wasn't looking for profit?  What if you and your neighbours were in complete control?  What if you couldn't be renovicted or surprised by a rent increase?  What if you could have a permanent reliable home without paying Toronto real estate prices?
	</p>

	<p>
		We have an opportunity to do something new, that was illegal for 60 years.  We're going to create potentially endless amounts of ideal housing, homes that will raise our quality of life.
	</p>

	<p>
		We're building co-ops.  New co-ops, in the inner suburbs.  We're also building multiplexes, the incredibly popular (and recently legalized) small buildings with 4 homes per building.
	</p>

	<p>
		Co-ops are housing where the residents (members) are in charge.  Rent is decided (democratically) at a rate just enough to cover for expenses, not to pay for someone else's retirement.
	</p>


	<h3>Why live here?</h3>

	<p>
		The good news, you are in control.  Everything from HOA-style rules, to rent increases, to how often to mow the lawn is decided by you and your neighbours, through democratic decisions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The bad news, you are in control.  You and your neighbours will have almost complete control over your property, and it's your responsibility to make smart choices for your future.
	</p>

		Co-op housing has all the advantages and disadvantages of democracy, because fundamentally that's exactly what makes a co-op different from any other type of organization.  It's entirely democratic.
	</p>

	<p>
		For existing co-ops in Toronto, you apply to become a member, very similar to renting an apartment.  Except, currently the waiting lists are very long and/or closed.
	</p>

	<p>
		For our development co-op, filling out the application form adds you to the waiting list to become a member.  Once you're a member you'll have control over development plans.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once each building is completed, four families will be able to become members of that housing co-op.
	</p>



	<h3>Who's going to actually do this?</h3>

	<p>Ultimately, you.</p>

	<p>Currently, development is led by a group that has lived in and run co-ops for many years.</p>

	<p>The organization doing the development is a co-op. So you, as a member, elect the board that sets the direction.</p>

	<p>There will be employees and partners that understand the technical issues.</p>

	<h3>Member Loans</h3>

	<p>Co-ops get some of their financing from members in the form of member loans.</p>

	<p>This is money that members provide to the co-op which is returned when they leave it.</p>

	<p>In this case, there are 2 co-ops. The development co-op and the housing co-op(s)</p>

	<p>
		The member loan for the development co-op is about $2.000. That is expected to cover a years expenses with about 100 members.
	</p>

	<p>
		The member loan for a housing co-op is larger. About 8 (4?) months rent. A member is expected to put that much (minus the $2,000) into an escrow account to be used for their member loan when they move into the co-op.
	</p>



	<h3>What next</h3>

	<p>The project will launch when we get 20 buildings worth of member loans in escrow</p>

	<p>At that point we will</p>
	<ul>
	<li>incorporate</li>
	<li>form a board</li>
	<li>hire an executive director</li>
	<li>hire a bookkeeper</li>
	<li>contract with a builder</li>
	<li>buy land</li>
	<li>arrange financing</li>
	</ul>
