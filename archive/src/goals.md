# Goals

The immediate goal of the project is to build an ecosystem of organizations to plan, finance, build, and govern non profit co-op housing in Toronto.

One of the major problems in Toronto is the lack of stable, affordable family housing.  Non profit co-ops may well be the best solution to this problem.  However, historically these have been built with government assistance, but with the election of conservative governments this activity has been crushed.

In order to maintain a consistent supply of this housing we need to build mechanisms to deliver it without government support, and possibly, in the teeth of government opposition.

Another Toronto issue is the dominance of the car dependent suburbs.  These are incredibly costly and significantly subsidized.  They also create substantial ecological problems.  A secondary objective of this project is to gradually reduce the car dependence by increasing the density, and ultimately, create walkable neighbourhoods.

The plan is to build highly energy efficient housing, which will address the wider problem of climate change.

You can be part of this transformative project, and get stable, long term affordable housing to boot.
