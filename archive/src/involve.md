# How to get involved

The starting point for getting involved is filling out the signup sheet.  

We will be contacting people who sign up to determine details of the kind of housing they want, and what level of participation they are willing to commit to.  The minimum expected standard is to attend members meetings (possibly virtually) and voting for board members.

The next point is putting up the member loan and the escrow money.  The current theory is that putting up the member loan gets you voting privileges and depositing the escrow money gets you on the waiting list.  Exactly how this works will be determined by the board.

At this point there will be an interview, we are looking for a commitment to co-op principles.  Normally this would be done by and individual co-op but in this case the waiting list is managed by the development organization.

We will be looking for board members.  See [Governance](governance.html) for what that entails.
