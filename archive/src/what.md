# What the building is

It is a trifle difficult to say for certain what the buildings will be since that depends on both what the members want and what the city will allow.

Members will get a chance to describe what they want in the initial expression of interest survey, and then the final decision will be by the board they elect (or possibly a vote at a members meeting).  

The situation with the city is uncertain, they have allowed 6 plexes but have not changed the maximum size (3 stories) of the building.  The only way to put 6 (or even 4) family size units is on very wide lots.

In any event the current plan for the buildings is to have the temperature controlled part of the building be a well insulated box with the interior having no load bearing walls (for flexibility).  Attached to, (but inulated from) are a balcony, stairs, elevator combination on the front and a stairwell on the back.  The balconies will be quite deep (min 10 feet) and finished such that barbequing is possible.

Heating/cooling will be by in ground heat pumps, on a neighbourhood scale if we can do it.

On less than large lots the family sized units will take up the whole floor. Two two bedrooms will fit on a floor and on some buildings 3 one bedrooms will fit on the first floor.
