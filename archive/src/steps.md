# Steps

### Pitch site

The first thing to do is create a pitch site.  This requires completing the design of the project, writing advertising copy, and implementing a signup page.  Some partnership connections need to be made at this point to determine costs accurately enough to fairly present the options to applicants.

### Connect with partners

We need to connect with the partners required to implement the project.  At this point we are looking for expressions of interest and possibly early cost estimates.

### Launch pitch

This is primarily an advertising campaign in order to get the pitch site in front of potential members.  Current thinking thinking is that this means a launch event and media campaigns (including social media and earned media).

### Get pitch responses

This is primarily waiting for people to fill in the application.  We will also have to respond to questions.  

This is the first go/no go decision point in the project.  If there is not enough interest at this point the project will not proceed.  See [Decision point](decision.html).

### Formalization

This is mostly legal issues.  It would start with incorporation of all the co-ops.  We would need to confirm the regulatory issues surrounding the variable rate bonds.  This may take significant time.  Agreements with partners would need to be confirmed with letters of intent.

### Sign membership agreements

We need to sign membership agreements and receive member loans and escrow deposits from applicants.  This is the second go/no go decision point. See [Decision point](decision.html).

### Sign partnership agreements

Signing partnership agreements is the final legal step required before land acquisition occurs and the building process begins.

### Build

For each property and building we need to: acquire property, get building approval, start building, finish building and move people in.
