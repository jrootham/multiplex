# Next steps

Winter and early spring of 2025 will be taken up with project design and organization.  This will include building a sign up page, connecting with partners, and arranging the finance structure.

Spring and early summer will be spent getting people to do the expression of interest signing up.  This is the first go/no go [decision point](decision.html).

The legal organization will be done in the late summer.

Getting members to sign up and advancing the money will happen in the fall.  This is the second go/no go [decision point](decision.html).

When the members are signed up a board will be elected which will make the final decisions on staffing and building design and whatever else needs settling.

Property acquisition and getting permits will begin to happen in the winter.  It is an open question whether construction starts immediately or waits until spring.  This process will continue indefinitely.
