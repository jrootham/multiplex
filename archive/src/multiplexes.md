# Multiplexes

A multiplex is a small apartment building.  The difference between an apartment building and a multiplex is simply one of terminology.  Current usage says that multiplexes start at 2 apartments (duplex).  The upper limit is somewhat amorphous, but one would expect a ten unit building to be referred to as an apartment building.

The big advantage of multiplexes is the balance between the land use efficiency of a high rise and the desirabiliy of a single family home.  Jan Gehl in "Cities for People" used human perception studies to identify 25 metres as the maximum height for people to relate to the street.

The density enabled by multiplexes should be enough to transform car dependent suburbs into walkable neighbourhoods.
