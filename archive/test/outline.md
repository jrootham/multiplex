      * Assumes stairs and elevator are outside the basic box
    * Consistent delivery schedule for long term planning
  * Marketing
    * Development co-op
      * Members are the wait list
      * Determines where and what to build
    * There is an escrow account that holds the member loan money
      * Money is deposited in a low risk investment vehicle
      * Returns are deposited in the escrow account
      * No lock in, may leave at any time, access to money is by the rules of the investment vehicle
    * 
    * Not for profit land trust (preferably indigenous)
      * Gets a donation of money
      * Buys the land, leases to the co-op
        * Legalities need checking on land transfer tax
  * Transition
    * When a building is done people on the waiting list with enough money to cover the member loan are elegible to join the new co-op
      * Pass an orientation interview
        * Initially by the development co-op
        * Later by the housing co-ops
    * People who sell the land to the land trust are first in line to join the co-op
