# Heat Pump Co-op

One of the long term issues facing us now is how to heat and cool housing with a low carbon footprint.

It turns out that in ground heat pumps are more economical at scales larger than small buildings.

In the context of this project it means we should try to spread the benefits and costs of heat pumps to the surrounding neighbourhood.  One way of doing this would be to create a separate neighbourhood heating/cooling co-op and invite the existing neighbours to join.  It would be financed with the same member loan/monthly charged structure as the housing co-op.  If a member of that co-op sold their home to the housing co-op the member loan would be picked up by the housing co-op.
