# Building Design and Construction

Building design and construction involves a large number of trade offs.  The obvious one is quality vs costs, but you also have flexibility vs capital cost and approval processes.  Another consideration at this point is to minimize the carbon footprint over the life of the building.

The intention here is to minimize the total cost which is the sum of mortgage, operating, and replacement reserve costs, paying due attention to the carbon footprint.

The proposed approach is to base the design on a post and beam factory built building with no internal load bearing walls and options for the placement of kitchens and bathrooms.  It should be built to passive house insulation standards.  This will also imply heat exchangers (or whatever they are calling them now) for ventilation.

The main building should be a rectangular box with elevators, stairs, and balconies pinned to the outside.  

Elevators are required for freight, accessibility, and stretchers.

The balconies should be large (minimum 3 meter depth) and fire resistant enough to support barbequing.
