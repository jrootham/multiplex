# Staffing

The minimum staffing during the start up period (before enough units get built to support housing co-op staff, about 25) would be 1 general co-ordinator, 1 part time bookkeeper, and 1 part time maintenance person (after the first building).  After the start up period the maintenance person would transfer to the housing co-op.

Current estimate is that this (with overheads) will total about $200,000 per year.

If as and when the building rate scales up, the increased staffing costs will be supported by increased income from fees paid by the housing co-op as part of the capital costs.
