# Community Land Trust

A Community Land Trust (CLT) acquires and retains lands in perpetuity for community benefit through a combination of donations and purchases.

* The CLT acts as an anchor for asset transfers from governments, foundations, and private donors interested in preserving it for the public good. 

* In a housing context, the CLT removes land and housing from the speculative real estate market and perpetually holds it in a trust to preserve the affordability of that land and housing asset. 

The preceding statement is from the Toronto Indigenous Community Land Trust.

They would be a preferred partner because of reconciliation and being part of the land back movement.
