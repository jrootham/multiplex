# Why live here?

The good news, you are in control.  Everything from HOA-style rules, to rent increases, to how often to mow the lawn is decided by you and your neighbours, through democratic decisions.

The bad news, you are in control.  You and your neighbours will have almost complete control over your property, and it's your responsibility to make smart choices for your future.

Co-op housing has all the advantages and disadvantages of democracy, because fundamentally that's exactly what makes a co-op different from any other type of organization.  It's entirely democratic.

For existing co-ops in Toronto, you apply to become a member, very similar to renting an apartment.  Except, currently the waiting lists are very long and/or closed.

For our development co-op, filling out the application form adds you to the waiting list to become a member.  Once you're a member you'll have control over development plans.

Once each building is completed, four families will be able to become members of that housing co-op.
