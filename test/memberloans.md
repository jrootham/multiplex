# Member Loans

Co-ops get some of their financing from members in the form of member loans.

This is money that members provide to the co-op which is returned when they leave it.

In this case, there are 2 co-ops. The development co-op and the housing co-op(s)

The member loan for the development co-op is about $2.000. That is expected to cover a years expenses with about 100 members.

The member loan for a housing co-op is larger. About 8 (4?) months rent. A member is expected to put that much (minus the $2,000) into an escrow account to be used for their member loan when they move into the co-op.
