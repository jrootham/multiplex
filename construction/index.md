A multiplex is a small apartment building. The difference between an apartment building and a multiplex is simply one of terminology. Current usage says that multiplexes start at 2 apartments (duplex). The upper limit is somewhat amorphous, but one would expect a ten unit building to be referred to as an apartment building.

The big advantage of multiplexes is the balance between the land use efficiency of a high rise and the desirabiliy of a single family home. Jan Gehl in "Cities for People" used human perception studies to identify 25 metres as the maximum height for people to relate to the street.

The density enabled by multiplexes should be enough to transform car dependent suburbs into walkable neighbourhoods.

### Building Design

Building Design and Construction

Building design and construction involves a large number of trade offs. The obvious one is quality vs costs, but you also have flexibility vs capital cost and approval processes. Another consideration at this point is to minimize the carbon footprint over the life of the building.

The intention here is to minimize the total cost which is the sum of mortgage, operating, and replacement reserve costs, paying due attention to the carbon footprint.

The proposed approach is to base the design on a post and beam factory built building with no internal load bearing walls and options for the placement of kitchens and bathrooms. It should be built at least close to passive house insulation standards. This will also imply heat exchangers (or whatever they are calling them now) for ventilation.

The main building should be a standard size rectangular box with elevators, stairs, and balconies pinned to the outside.

Elevators are required for freight, accessibility, and stretchers.

The balconies should be large (current design 4 meter depth) and fire resistant enough to support barbequing.

There are issues with zoning constraints. The pilot project for 6-plexes as of right is helpful, but given height limits and other rules it is not possible to deliver muliple units of family housing.

The current plan is for four story buildings, with each floor being one of: whole floor (3-4 bedrooms), 2 per floor (2 bedrooms), or 3 per floor (one bedroom).

There should be a consistent delivery schedule for long term planning.

#### Where (Location)

A review of the property boundary files of the city of Toronto indicates there are approximately 300,000 properties of a size that could hold a 4 unit multiplex. Assuming approximately ten per cent would be feasible in the short to medium term means that if this was all built out there would be about 120,000 more dwelling units in the city which could house on the order of 250,000 people. This should put something of a dent in the demand/supply ratio.

Below is a map of all the properties in Toronto with a frontage of between 9 meters and 20 meters and a depth between 30 meters and 60 meters, coloured by frontage.
